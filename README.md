# Introduction: Digital patient

Project Portfolio 4 for Code Institute Full-stack development program. Digital patient is a full stack Django project that runs on Heroku.

The site allows users to register and log in from the frontend. Once registered and logged in users can edit personal data, edit, add and delete diseases/medications, doctors and contacts.

The live website on Heroku can be accessed at the following link: [View my Live Website here](https://digital-patient-807175a8312b.herokuapp.com/)

## UX

### Site purpose

This program is designed to make it easier for a patient to keep track of their doctors, diseases, medications, as well as (emergency) contacts. In addition, in the case of an emergency, it should be possible for doctors to see a readable version of the patient's profile to see previous diseases, medications, previous doctors and emergency contacts.

### Site goal

To build a website where a kind of digital patient dossier can be easily shared by the patient him/herself for possible emergencies.

A tool like this does not (yet) exist in Germany, and in the case of an emergency with, for example, an unconscious patient, the doctors may not know any previous diseases, medications, general practitioners or emergency contacts, or they may first have to laboriously collect these on individual platforms or (mobile) devices.

### Audience

For anyone who wants to have all their emergency data on one platform for potential doctors in case of an emergency.
